# N8N Public Workflows

This is a free for use repository of the various workflows I've created for one reason or another.

Please see the export/import [N8N Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/workflows/#export-and-import-a-workflow) for details on how to transfer these to your N8N projects

## Intro

As of this writing these workflows are not drop-in solutions. You need your own creds if that's required for the various services the flows use.
You can easily [add and link credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/) once you save these in your own workflows.  

Ideally this will help others get going with N8N integrations and micro services.

## [Get Started](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/#what-do-i-need-to-get-started)

### Prerequisites/Dependencies
- n8n set up: You can use the self-hosted version, n8n Cloud, or the desktop app.
- A user ID: Sign up here to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and APIs would be helpful, but is not necessary.

## Navigating this repository
At this time there is only one folder, but there will probably be more soon.  
The folders in this repository represent the unique phrase of the app they were built in. The first app being "goldfish" because that's the phrase in the N8N instances URL where it's hosted.  

If you've found this because of a video, this organization should help you find where the thing is you saw.
